# Where I put each file

I created two directories, **back-end** and **my-site** in _/var/www/_

I created one directory, **hello-server** in _/var/log/_

**hello-server** is in _/var/www/back-end/_

**index.html** is in _/var/www/my-site/_

**hello.conf** is in _/etc/nginx/sites-available/_

I created a symbolic link of hello.conf in _/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/_

**hello-server.service** is in _/etc/systemd/system/_
