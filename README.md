# Where I put each file

I created two directories, "back-end" and "my-site" in /var/www/

hello-server is in /var/www/back-end/

index.html is in /var/www/my-site/

hello.conf is in /etc/nginx/sites-available/
I created a symbolic link of hello.conf in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

hello-server.service is in /etc/systemd/system/
